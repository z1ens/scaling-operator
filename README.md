# Scaling-operator
This is a simple scaling operator based on operator-sdk, it can scale up or down to the number of replicas you want.

## Description
The detail of this scaling operator is described in both `scaler_types.go` and also `scaler_controller.go`, which contains the spec and also the scaling logic of the scaling operator.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, and also Kubernetes enabled.
2. Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run, You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster. You might need to install kind if it's not installed yet in your environment.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Clone this project, direct to the folder.

2. Create a local cluster, here I use kind as an example. Make sure Docker is running in the background.
```sh
kind create cluster
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/api.nextfaas.com_scalers.yaml
```
You can check the CRD if it's correctly installed with this command:

```sh
kubectl get crd
```

4. Now you can deploy one function to test the scaling operator. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/scaling-operator:tag
```

5. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/scaling-operator:tag
```

6. Run the Operator:
   
```sh
make run
```

7. Apply the scaling requirements:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/api_v1alpha1_scaler.yaml
```

8. See the result of the replicas:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```


### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
